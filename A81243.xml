            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>This is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not heare the Law of the Lord.</hi> There they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and resolve not to be <hi>good themselves.</hi> ver. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They say to the Soers, See not: and to the Prophets, Prophecy not unto us right things: speake unto us smooth things, prophecy deceits. Get ye out of the way: turne aside out of the path: cause the holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</hi> And so they doe not only <hi>refuse</hi> to walk in the light, but <hi>extinguish</hi> it: as they will not be good themselves, so <hi>neither</hi> will they <hi>suffer others</hi> to be good: Not only <hi>rebelling</hi> against the <hi>meanes</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> but by all meanes <hi>suppressing</hi> them. There you have their <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>wrath</hi> also threatned lies scattered from the beginning of the Chapter to the very Text, but it is epitomiz'd, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14. and the first Character of this <hi>wrath</hi> is, that it is <hi>Irresistible,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>This iniquitie shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in an high wall, whose breaking commeth suddenly at an instant.</hi> i. e. one might as well stand before a <hi>wall,</hi> an <hi>high wall,</hi> where no breach was <hi>suspected,</hi> and is even now <hi>falling,</hi> as be able to stand before this judgement threatned; where all the advantages of making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance are taken away.</p>
            <p>And as it is <hi>irresistible,</hi> so it is <hi>irrecoverable,</hi> as it could not be <hi>prevented,</hi> so neither shall it be <hi>repaired.</hi> For <hi>he shall breake it as the breaking of the potters ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that is broken in pieces, he shall not spare; so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it, a sheard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withall out of the pit.</hi> If a <hi>woodden</hi> vessell were broken it might be mended againe, (though perhaps not to be so service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as before;) but an <hi>earthen</hi> vessell not so easily, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:136952:7"/>it were broken but into two pieces; how much lesse if into more? and yet if but into three or foure pieces, suppose it could not be made into one intire vessell againe, yet some use might be made of the severall pieces, either to lathe water withall out of the pit, or to carry a coale or two to make fire with on the hearth; but not so here: This vessell must be broken into such small shivers that there shall not be a peice fit to carry a coale of fire, or a few drops of water: so that it should remaine not only <hi>irreparable,</hi> but altogether <hi>unserviceable;</hi> such was the <hi>wrath</hi> threatned against this people.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>sin</hi> of the people <hi>against God;</hi> and this <hi>wrath</hi> of God against this people is all the bottome we can find whereon to set this <hi>Therefore</hi> in the Text, if we look <hi>backward. Therefore</hi> will the Lord wait to be gracious, &amp;c. <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>wrath!</hi> a strange <hi>Therefore</hi> of mercy.</p>
            <p>If we look <hi>forward,</hi> we shall finde some firmer foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a <hi>Therefore</hi> of this nature. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a double Ground or Foundation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord will wait that he may be gracious to you:</hi> There's the <hi>Ground.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He will be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you;</hi> or, He will have mercy upon you, that he <hi>may be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> there's the <hi>End.</hi> God <hi>will</hi> doe it, <hi>because</hi> he <hi>will</hi> doe it: and, God will doe it, that he <hi>may be exalted:</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> and his <hi>Glory</hi> the <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Doctrine which the dependance or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Text affords from this word <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> is this:</p>

            <p>But this I shall passe over at this time:</p>
            <p>The thing that I intend to pitch upon lies in the body of the Text: as it holds out a word of Comfort and encouragement to the people of God in sad and troublesome times: For upon this sad prediction of <hi>irresistible</hi> and <hi>irreparable</hi> judgement, in the former part of the Chapter, it might be objected (and that even by Gods owne people.)
<note place="margin">Psal. 77.7.8.9.</note> And <hi>will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercie clean gone for ever? doth his Promise</hi> (his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob) faile for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi> will <hi>he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For whose succour and satisfaction the Prophet replies (as it were) no; the Lord hath not forgot his Covenant, neither will he cast off his people: but though he hath resolv'd to chastise them for their great and bitter provocations, yet he knowes both <hi>how</hi> and <hi>when</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi> them that are his: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them he <hi>will.</hi> Only you must give him leave to take his owne time; and it shall be the best time. He is a God of <hi>judgement.</hi> i. e. a <hi>just</hi> God, and a <hi>wise</hi> God, and therefore he will doe it, when it shall be most seasonable; he will <hi>wait</hi> the fittest opportunity, and therefore in the <hi>interim</hi> it will be both your duty and your wisdome to <hi>wait</hi> his leasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord will wait that he may be gracious unto you,

               </label>
               <hi>Waiting</hi> you must know, is <hi>improperly</hi> attributed unto God; for simply and in proper sense <hi>waiting</hi> implies three things.</p>

            </p>

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Waiting</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken implyes three things.</note>
               <hi>Present disability</hi> for the accomplishment of ones purposes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Expectation of future,</hi> and better opportunity, as we see in <hi>Esau, The dayes of mourning for my father are at hand,
<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. In God there is no deficiency of power and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to accomplish his designes more at one time than another; and therefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. There can be no need why God should expect a future or better opportunity, to <hi>morrow</hi> then to <hi>day, hereafter</hi> then <hi>now</hi> in regard of himself, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of his purposes.</p>

            <p>Now even in regard of the Enemies and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of his people, God many times waits, <hi>i. e.</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends and adjourns their enlargment and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and that is, till the enemies have <hi>fild up</hi> the measure of <hi>their iniquitie</hi> to the full, as we see in the case of the Israelites in Egypt.

No, nor (it seems) were the sins of the Egyptians full; for even after the Israelites deliverance was set on foot, and they expected now a speedy and finall accomplishment of Gods promise by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the work met with so many and almost desperate set-backs, that they seemed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be further off from deliverance than ever before, in so much that the people fell foule on <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,

            <p>The beleeving Hebrews had a long time groaned under the yokes of their oppression, their wounds did smart, and they had lookt many a long look when God should bow the heavens and come downe to their deliverance, and for want thereof they began to call either <hi>Gods love</hi> to them,

            <p>It fares with Christians many times as it did with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> they are weary of the <hi>footmen,</hi>

            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:136952:11"/>
            <p>And therfore it is very remarkable that in all Church-Histories you shall find, that <hi>Persecution</hi> hath alwaies been a fore-runner of <hi>Deliverance;</hi> as the Israelites <hi>enlargement</hi> out of the Egyptian slavery <hi>began</hi> in the <hi>doubling of their burdens</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> and the <hi>neerer</hi> the <hi>Deliverance</hi> the <hi>hotter</hi> alwaies hath bin the <hi>fire</hi> of Persecution; the Reason whereof I conceive to be, partly because at such times God hath usually stirred up the Spirits of some of his faithfull <hi>Witnesses</hi> to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi> and <hi>protest</hi> against the horrible impleties &amp; vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies of the Tyrants and oppressors of his people; to the end that all that see their approching destruction may justifie God in the execution of his righteous judgements. So God stirred up the Spirit of <hi>Luther</hi> and others to protest against the pride, lust and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Pope and papall Hierarchy, whereby the rage and indignation of that Antichristian gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was then (as before and since in divers ages and places of the Christian world) kindled into slames of fiery persecution upon the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>Partly because, as I said, they must fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their iniquities; their pride and covetousnesse, and lasciviousnesse, and violence, and crueltie must rise to the height, before God will deliver his people from their tyranny and oppression; and so like their father the divell they rage most when they are <hi>neerest to be cast out.</hi>

<note place="margin">2. God waits on his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ones. For 1.

            <p>Many more particulars might be added to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<note place="margin">2. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Graces, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>scil.</hi> the blasting of their corruptions, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, exercise and brightning of their graces, the holding them forth to the world, as wicked mens shame, Satans confutation, the world's wonder, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions justification, Angels delight, and Gods glory. But I cannot dwell upon these things. I must hast to the third consideration.</p>
            <p>A third consideration why God <hi>waits</hi> to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is in <hi>relation</hi> to his <hi>owne Name;</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reason or Confideration why God waits The glory of his own Name</note> that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and work for the honour of his Name, and this also is in reference to his people. For truly there is so much Idolatry even in their hearts, that if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>by means</hi> they are ready to ascribe deliverance <hi>to means,</hi> In regard whereof God is fain to suspend their rescues and salvations till the tide of second causes runne so low, that there is hardly adrop to be seen in the channel that is able to bear up their hopes and expectations, that so there may be nothing to share with God in the glory of their deliverances. Thus he would not fully and finally rescue his Israel
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:136952:13"/>from the oppression and opposition of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Egyptians, till their inclosure between the <hi>red Sea before them,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Armies of the Egyptians</hi> like <hi>another red Sea behind</hi> them, and an <hi>unpassable</hi> wildernesse on either fide, made them to see their deliverance impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the view of second causes; while there was no way of escape left open to them, unlesse they could have gone upward to heaven; and because they could not <hi>goe up</hi> to heaven, <hi>heaven came downe</hi> to them and saved them; and the end why God sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their deliverance, till they were brought to this desperate strait and exigence, the Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isaiah</hi> 63.</note> was that <hi>God might make himselfe an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Name,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>a glorious Name,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
            <p>And therefore would not God save his people in Babylon from the bloudy designe of <hi>Haman,</hi> till the <hi>letters</hi> were <hi>sealed</hi> with the <hi>Kings seale,</hi> the <hi>Posts</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched away with their Commissions into all his Kingdomes, and nothing now wanting but the day wherein the cruell Babylonians might make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves drunk with healths of Hebrew blood; all now at a desperate losse, that so the <hi>wisedome,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> of God might shine forth most gloriously in that miraculous salvation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Gideon</hi> was to encounter the Midianites,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Judges</hi> 7.2.</note> God told him, <hi>The people that are with thee are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for me to give the Midianites into their hand.</hi> Too many? how so? for alas they were at most but thirty thousand, when the Midianites were as the sand of the fea for multitude, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. well, twenty thousand are sent home again for <hi>milk-sops,</hi> ver. 3. and but ten thousand remains, an inconsiderable company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Midianites, and yet <hi>too many,</hi> vers. 4.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136952:14"/>well (short work to make) they must be all sent back to three hundred, of whom one might have said, as <hi>Andrew</hi> of the five loaves and two fishes, <hi>What are they among so many?</hi> And why must these doe the deed? God himself gives <hi>Gideon</hi> this account of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, and say mine owne hand hath saved me. Lest Ifrael vaunt!</hi> Oh wonder of pride and Idolatry! what will <hi>Israel</hi> doe so vilely? yes (Brethren) it is not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that was ignorant of God but <hi>Israel</hi> too; There was so much pride and ignorance and Idolatry even in Gods owne Israel, that if God save them <hi>by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> they will attribute deliverance <hi>to themselves; Mine owne hand dath saved mee.</hi> To informe which ignorance, and to correct which pride, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which Idolatry in the hearts of his owne people God <hi>waits</hi> till there is not a second cause to be seene to come into their succour, that there being none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to whom it is possble to attribute deliverance, he alone may carry away the repute and glory of it; and so God often gives the account, <hi>I will doe thus and thus.

            <p>He is a wise God, and therefore he knows when the enemies sinnes are full, as the husbandman knows when his corn is fully ripe. One that dwells in the Citie, or a Scholar in the Universitie perhaps doth not know, they may think it ripe, before it is ripe; but the husbandman knows exactly when it is fit for the sickle, and to this very Metaphor doth God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude: <hi>Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe, the presse is full,

            <p>He is <hi>wise</hi> and knows also when his people have smarted enough: as a wise Physician or Chirurgion knows when his Patient hath bled enough, and will not let him loose a drop of good bloud, he takes away none but that which is better out then in.

               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">The sins of Gods people have an hand in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches trouble.</note> Consider that what evils are upon Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you have had an hand in the procuring of them, that fire which you behold devouring Kingdomes,

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>3</label> Remember that none shall <hi>rejoyce with Sion</hi> but those that <hi>mourn with her.

               <p>I should proceed to make some farther use of this doctrine, the breasts of it are full of consolation, out of which you may such and be satisfied; but because the work is long and my time short, I will therefore hasten to the use which the holy Ghost makes of it, here in the Text, which is to stirre up all the people of God, that since God waits to be gracious, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They should therefore learne to wait upon God. <hi>Blessed are they that wait on him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>First, for the duty.</p>
               <p>It is a duty <hi>David</hi> commends to all the people of God under the pressures and oppressions of wicked men. <hi>Wait on the Lord and keep his way, and he shall

               <p>And the Prophet prescribes thee no physick but such as he took himselfe: he gives thee no counsell, but such as he chargeth upon his own soule.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.14.</note>
                  <hi>Wait on the Lord,</hi> he bespeaks himself, as you may see, <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>I had fainted, unlesse I had believed.</hi> Well, saith he, doe so still oh my soule, wait on the Lord; <hi>wait I say on the Lord; doe</hi> it, <hi>see thou doe it.</hi> I charge thee wait on God, and thou shalt not lose thy labour, <hi>He will strengthen thy heart.</hi> Yea, it is a duty that God enjoyns all his people at all times, <hi>Turn thou to thy God,

<note place="margin">Consists of 3. Ingredients.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the opening and pressing of this duty, I will briefly shew you</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is to wait on God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some directions to get your heart into a wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting frame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some encouragements or Motives.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the first</hi> take notice that there be <hi>three especiall ingredients</hi> goe to the making up of this duty, which I will but name, and then presse them upon you by way of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first ingredient</hi> in waiting on God is,
<note place="margin">1. Ingredient, Faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</note>
                  <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not seen.</hi> That is, Faith gives the soule a substantiall, firme and clear bottome to stand upon,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136952:21"/>while it waits upon God, though the things we wait for do not appeare to sense and reason; and therefore saith <hi>David</hi> in the forequoted place,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.13.</note>
                  <hi>I had utterly fainted, unlesse I had beleeved. [I had utterly fainted]</hi> is not the Text; the Hebrew reads onely, <hi>unlesse I had beleeved,</hi> the other is in the sense. I had fainted, I had sunk over head and eares in fears and despairs, had I not beleeved. <hi>Faith</hi> was the bottome of his waiting on God.
<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. 2. q. 40. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. <hi>desperatio importat quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam recessum à re desideratâ propter impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatem adipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>Nullum pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum donec ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus victus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patientia resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendi.</hi> Tertull. de ira.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Omne peccatum est impatientia.</hi> Idem.</p>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> discovered to him on what grounds he might stand; as namely, Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and All-sufficiency, &amp;c. and therefore he doth still encourage himself to hold on this course, <hi>wait on God, wait I say on the Lord.</hi> He that <hi>beleeveth not,</hi> doth not <hi>wait</hi> but <hi>despaire.</hi> And therefore the Schooles define despaire to be <hi>Quando animus impossibilitate victus, cedit,</hi> when a man taken captive with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of impossibility gives over waiting and working, as he did, <hi>This evill is of the Lord, why should I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> As <hi>Tertullian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves of sinne, that it is the yeelding up of the soule when it is impatient of resisting any longer: So may I say of despaire, it is the yeelding up of the soul when it is impatient of waiting any longer.</p>
               <p>The second ingredient is <hi>Patience;
<note place="margin">2. Ingredient, Patience.</note> Waiting</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes delay, and delay without patience is insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart sick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12.</note> Delay is a sore sicknesse, and patience is the onely cure of it, without which, that sicknesse will prove death, <hi>I had utterly fainted, ut sup.</hi> If we hope for that we see not,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25.</note> then <hi>doe we with patience wait for it.</hi> Patience is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soule and life of waiting, waiting without patience is nothing else but <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>enraged discontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Ingredient is <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>activity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Ingredient, Diligence.</note> He
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:136952:22"/>that waiteth for a mercie, must serve Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the use of all the means which God hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for the accomplishment thereof, it is <hi>diligence</hi> as well as <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> that must inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>We desire that every one of you doe shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11.12.</note> that ye be not slothfull, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</hi> Waiting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence is nothing but slothfulnesse and security.
<note place="margin">These three prest by way of Exhortation. 1. Wait Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave now to presse these three upon you by way of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>First then, Wait <hi>beleevingly,</hi> oh thou afflicted, tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with tempest, and not comforted, whether for the Churches sorrows, or thine owne sufferings, <hi>He that shall come,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.</note> will come, and will not tarry.</hi> The visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for an appointed time (saith the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> to the Church and people in his dayes) but what shall we doe (might they say) in the mean time? why, you must tarry, <hi>wait for it.</hi> How? it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next verse, <hi>The just shall live by saith.</hi> He that cannot beleeve, cannot live; when troubles come, and dangers come, and fears come, his hope will dye, his comfort will dye, his heart will dye, and sinke within him like a stone, as <hi>Nabals</hi> did; get faith, or in a time of trouble you are but dead men. Christians should wait for God, as the husbandman doth for the harvest.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7.</note>
                  <hi>Behold, the husbandman wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for the pretious fruits of the earth,</hi> how doth he wait? as with <hi>patience,</hi> so with <hi>faith.</hi> Husbandmen even such as want <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>saving</hi> faith, doe yet by a <hi>naturall</hi> faith bear up themselves in the expectation of a harvest; a naturall faith, I say, arising meerly from the observation of the constant course and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:136952:22"/>circle of providence, wherby he sees it comes to passe (according to the Promise and Covenant of God after the deluge) that <hi>Seed-time</hi> and <hi>Harvest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22.</note> cold and heat, summer and winter, &amp;c. doe never cease: and therefore herein he doth comfort and support him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe over all his cost, and travell of feed-time, his harvest he hopes will make him amends for all. Let Gods people learne of the Husbandman; and from the constant experience and observation of Gods faithfulnesse, and all-sufficiencie in the constant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his providence towards his suffring Church and people, learn to wait on God not with a naturall only but a divine faith, and gracious recumbencie of Spirit. <hi>Light is sowne for the righteous:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11.</note> and joy for the upright in heart. Light is sowne,</hi> it is <hi>seed time</hi> now, it will be <hi>harvest</hi> hereafter, when <hi>they that sow in tears, shall reap in joy:</hi> when they that carry forth precious <hi>seed weeping,</hi> shall come againe <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and bring their <hi>sheaves</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the Church beleevingly encourage her selfe, <hi>Isai.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> See how holily confident she is! it is not <hi>perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> or it <hi>may be,</hi> or <hi>who knowes?</hi> (as some where in Scripture) but He <hi>will save us,</hi> we <hi>will,</hi> or we <hi>shall</hi> rejoyce and be glad in that Salvation which he will vouchsafe unto us. As a wife whose husband at his departure sets her a day wherein she should expect his returne; till the day comes she waits, and supports her selfe with the approach of the promise of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: and when the day comes, she waits till dinner time, but he comes not (it may be) till supper, and she
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:136952:23"/>cannot see him; it growes late, and her servants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire her to goe to bed, for surely say they the Master will not come to night; nay, but she waits still from houre to houre, and resolves to wait till break of day, for saith she, he will come, he <hi>promist</hi> me he would come, and he never broke promise with me yet; I know he will not faile me now, if he be alive: So saith the beleeving soul, This is our God, we have waited for him, he will save us, he hath <hi>promised</hi> to save us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.10.18.</note> if we wait upon him, and he never failed his people yet; and therefore though some unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and distrustfull thoughts would tempt it to lie downe in despaire, yet the soule resolves to wait till the day dawne and the sun of Righteousnesse arise upon it with healing in his wings. He <hi>will</hi> come, he said he would come; we <hi>shall</hi> rejoyce and be glad in his Salvation.</p>
               <p>And therefore let all that mourne for Sion, and sigh and weep for her pressures and oppressions read over the Promises wherein God hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the rescue and redemption of his persecuted languishing Church and people; and make <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> of all the <hi>Monuments</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> of Gods Faithfulnesse and All-sufficiency both <hi>publike</hi> and <hi>personall</hi> in making good his Promises; the Result whereof is <hi>as the waters of Noah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isai.</hi> 54.9.</note> or as the Covenant which God made upon the drying up of those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>scil.</hi> that as God sware then that the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> should no more return to cover the earth, so hath he also sworne that a deluge or inundation of affliction and persecution shall no more cover and <hi>drowne</hi> his waiting Church and people <hi>wholly</hi> and for <hi>ever. The Vision</hi> may <hi>be for an appointed time, but at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:136952:23"/>the end it shall speake, and not lie,</hi> and therefore <hi>though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry;</hi> though it may seeme to tarry <hi>your time,</hi> it will not tarry <hi>Gods time;</hi> wait <hi>Beleevingly:</hi> it will be your support, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.14. and Gods glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wait <hi>Patiently,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position 1. To restles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde.</note> and that in a two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, <hi>scil.</hi>

                  <hi>Are there any of the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause raine,</hi> i.e. are there any of the idols of the heathen whom they <hi>vainly,</hi> and foolishly, and falsly call gods, that can cause raine? they had indeed in times of drought sought to these poore dirty <hi>vanities</hi> for raine, but alas they were notable to create one drop of water. Can the heavens give showres? they had waited on the heavens; they had observed the windes and the clouds, and the signes and tokens of heaven; and when the wind blew South, and the Moon chang'd; and the skies lookt red and louring;

               <p>Take along with you a parallel place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Truly in vain is Salvation looked for from the hils, and from the multitude of mountaines,</hi> i.e. either from their <hi>Idols</hi> who were plac'd and worship'd in the Hils and mountaines, or from <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> who over looke their neighbours as much as the hils doe the poore low vallies, or the mountaines the little hils; yea though there were multitudes of them, hils upon hils, mountaines upon mountaines, people upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, armies upon armies, multitudes of nations and people united and combined together with power and policie, <hi>in vaine</hi> is salvation, deliverance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:136952:30"/>looked for from them all; they had found it by dear-bought experience, and so they confesse, ver. 24. <hi>for shame hath devoured the labours of our fathers,</hi> &amp;c: when the Egyptians were upon them, then they ran to Assyria for helpe, and when the Assyrians came against them, then they fled to Egypt for succour; <hi>Ephraim is a silly dove without heart, they call to Egypt,

               </p>
               <p>Now from this consideration the like inference is implyed here, which they made before in the former place; <hi>Therefore we will wait upon thee;</hi> and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in some such language, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Ashur shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherlesse finde mercy.</hi>

               <p>Brethren, let their folly and our own too teach us wisdome; and from such experiences lets learne to dispute and reason our selves into a sweet holy wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting frame of heart.

                  <hi>Because of his strength, I will wait upon God, for God is my defence.</hi> No <hi>strength</hi> but in the Lord <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> no <hi>defence</hi> but in the <hi>Rock of Ages;</hi> Therefore will I wait on God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, consider God hath waited a long time
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:136952:31"/>for us.
<note place="margin">2. God hath waited for us.</note> How long did God wait upon thee before thy Conversion? calling inviting, intreating, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, wooing, promising, swearing unto thee, and thou wouldst not heare? How long hast thou made Christ wait at thy doore since thy Conversion? and knock there many times for entrance,

                  <hi>till his head hath been wet with the dew, and his locks with the drops of the night,</hi> i.e. very <hi>long,</hi> very <hi>late.</hi> Well, thinke with thy selfe if God waited so long for me, it is but an equall and an easie censure, if he make me <hi>wait</hi> a little while for him. If we should make a King wait at our doores an houre, it were more then if he should make us wait at his gates a week, a moneth, a yeere. <hi>I will beare,</hi> said the Church, <hi>the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9.</note> We will wait (may we say) the Lords leasure, because we have made him wait upon us a long time, it is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches resolution in the same place, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered her carriage against God in the former part of the Chapter, and could see nothing but murder and oppression, and covetousnesse, and treachery, and disloyaltie, and disobedience, &amp;c. in the midst of her streets, and therefore concludes, Well, I have made God wait all this while under my sinnes, therefore I will wait under his punishments, <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my Salvation,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vers. </seg>7</label> my God <hi>will heare me.</hi> Gods patience under our sins may well purchase our patience under his afflictions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yea consider, that even now,
<note place="margin">3. God doth wait now.</note> it is <hi>God</hi> that waits, not <hi>we.</hi> God yet waits for us rather then we wait for God: for some of those purposes which I discovered to you in the opening of the words. He is ready at this instant to give deliverance, but we have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:136952:32"/>not been, neither are to this day fit to receive delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, else we had had it before this time. The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent under his corroding and purging physick, cals for his cordials and restoratives, and complaines of his Physitian, if he delay him, as if he made him stay too long for his cordiall draughts: whereas in truth, the Physitian stayes for him, not he for the Physitian; the cordiall is ready in the Physitians closet, were the Patient fit for it: but alas the malignant poysonous humor is not yet purged and eaten out; to give a cordiall before that time were to gratifie and strengthen the distemper, not the patient.</p>
               <p>Thinke thus with your selfe when nationall and personall pressures seeme to lye too long: Oh if we, or I were fit for delivereance we should have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; God hath no delight to afflict more then need; were our pride and idolatry, and selfe love, and other malignant distempers purged out, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would come in alone, God waits for me; I will wait for him: <hi>The Lord waits that he may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. The blessing doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so much in the removing as in the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of an affliction. <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.12.</note> consider that the blessing doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the <hi>removing</hi> of an affliction, whether publike or private, but in the <hi>sanctifying</hi> of it. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou correctest and teachest in thy Law.</hi> He saith not, Blessed is the man who <hi>was in prison,</hi> and <hi>is enlarged;</hi> nor blessed is the man who <hi>was sick,</hi> and <hi>is recovered;</hi> nor blessed are the people, who were likely <hi>to have been consumed</hi> by civill warres, but now <hi>a Pacification</hi> is made, all warres are husht and gone, and the like; but blessed is the people or person whom thou <hi>correctest</hi> and <hi>teachest,</hi> when <hi>teachings</hi> go along with <hi>corrections</hi> there is the blessing; when by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:136952:32"/>affliction God teacheth a people or person, the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of sinne,</hi> the <hi>blessednesse of exact walking,</hi> the <hi>emptinesse of the Creature,</hi> and the <hi>fulnesse of Christ,</hi> they are blessed indeed. So <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.71.</note>
                  <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted:</hi> wherein? <hi>that I might learne thy statutes.</hi> By his afflictions God taught him to walk more <hi>exactly,</hi> and therein consisted his happinesse. <hi>It is good for me;</hi> Oh I would not have beene without this affliction for a world. And therefore if you would not <hi>make more hast</hi> then <hi>good speed</hi> out of your afflictions, labour more to get them <hi>sanctified</hi> then <hi>removed;</hi> chuse rather that the affliction should lie upon the all thy life then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved before God hath done thy soule good by it: and by this consideration, work thy heart in a waiting frame.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, learne to prize a waiting frame of heart more than a present deliverance: God may give a <hi>deliverance in wrath,</hi> but he never gives a <hi>waiting frame of heart,</hi> but it is <hi>in love. Impatience, frowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and <hi>unbeliefe</hi> may wrest a temporary delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Gods hand, but a woe will tread upon the heeles of such a deliverance; such a deliverance makes way for a greater judgement. But a waiting frame of Spirit is a Grace gotten by the exercise of Grace, given in grace and favour, a speciall fruit of Gods Love, and an infallible forerunner of a gracious enlargement: when God hath brought us to this that we can freely and cheerefully say to God, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> God is ready to say so to us, <hi>Blessed</hi> are they that <hi>wait</hi> for him.</p>
               <p>I have done with the Directions how to get your hearts into a waiting frame; but I would not that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:136952:33"/>you should have done with them also: but doe with them as you doe with oyle to a stiffe joynt, rub and chafe them upon your hearts by deep and frequent meditation and prayer; for remember that a waiting heart is a <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God, and must be fetcht out of the bloud of Christ; <hi>wrastle</hi> with God for it, and never let him goe, till he <hi>blesse</hi> you with it.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Motives and encouragements which lye in the heel of the Text, <hi>Blessed are they that wait upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a blessed thing to wait on God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Motives to wait on God.</note> Or, <hi>They be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that wait on God.</hi> And that in divers respects.</p>
               <p>First,
<note place="margin">1. They shall not be oshamed that wait on God. <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.23.</note> They that wait on God shall be blessed in the <hi>accomplishment of their hopes,</hi> in the <hi>answer of their expectation. They shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</hi> It is a shame to a man when he waits and misseth of his expectation. <hi>The troops of Tema looked, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Shebah waited for them,</hi> Job 6.19. namely, for the streams of brooks, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. which they saw when they passed by that way in winter, but now in the heat of summer, when they stood in most need of them, when their tongues were ready to cleave to the roofe of their mouths for thirst, <hi>they were vanisht and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of their places,</hi> vers. 17. What then follows? <hi>They were confounded because they had hoped, they came thither and were ashamed.</hi> Such is the fruit of creature confidence, and waiting on second causes, when God is left out or neglected: Second causes may prove abortive; Parliaments may miscarry; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies may be broken with furious storms, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.48.

               <p>Oh all you that with <hi>Jacob</hi> have waited for God's salvation, and with <hi>Simeon</hi> have waited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of our English Sion, be of good chear, you shall not be ashamed of your expectation; wait and wait <hi>beleevingly;</hi> wait, and wait <hi>patiently;</hi> wait, and wait <hi>actively;</hi> Surely the Lord will wait to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to <hi>England;</hi> surely he will be exalted that he may have mercy upon <hi>England.

               <p>And me thinks it should not be long first; that voice seems to sound in mine eares. <hi>Thus saith the Lord,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isai.</hi> 56.1.</note> keep judgement and doe justice for my salvation is neer to come, and my righteousnesse to be revealed.</hi> The righteous salvation of God toward his poor people in <hi>England</hi> is <hi>comming,</hi> and that not farre off, It is <hi>neer</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:136952:34"/>to come and <hi>ready</hi> to be <hi>revealed.</hi> God certainly my Brethren, intends to doe good to <hi>England,</hi> and (I could beleeve) it is neer, even at the very door, only if our unbeliefe and impatience doe not set back the clock of providence, and turn that journey into the land of promise which might be dispatcht, in forty dayes into a forty years pilgrimage, through a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of danger, difficulty and opposition.</p>
               <p>I say therefore to encourage and <hi>bribe</hi> all Gods people to a beleeving, patient, active waiting-for of God,

               </p>
               <p>And though I cannot preach this good newes to <hi>England</hi> as the Prophet did to Israel by immediate revelation; yet I speak not without good grounds of warrantable observation: for while I observe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the <hi>finger</hi> of God is in the Diall of Providence, I doe humbly conceive I may tell this good news to all that fear God, and wait for him in <hi>England, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy salvation commeth, behold his reward is with him and his work before him.</hi>

               <p>The first is hinted to us from the 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> where we find a Prophesie of the <hi>finall restauration of the Jewes,</hi> and the 11. <hi>vers.</hi> expresseth the time, which is 1290. <hi>years after the ceasing of the dayly sacrifice,</hi> and the setting up of the <hi>abomination of desolation,</hi> which is conceived to be in <hi>Julian</hi>'s <hi>time,</hi> who did essay to rebuild the <hi>Temple of the Jewes,</hi> which was an <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to God; who therefore to shew his <hi>just dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi> thereof <hi>destroyed</hi> it by <hi>fire</hi> (out of the earth) <hi>tearing</hi> up the very <hi>foundation</hi> thereof to the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stone, this was in the year 360. after Christ, to which if you adde 1290. years, it will pitch this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation upon the year 1650. And before this full and finall restauration of the Jewes (when ever it comes) <hi>Babylon</hi> must down, <hi>Rome</hi> must be destroyed, and it is very probable that these may be beginnings of <hi>that glorious work,</hi> which conjecture is strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from a</p>
               <p>Second conjecture bottom'd upon the prophesie of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:136952:35"/>the <hi>seven Vials,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second conjecture of the approch of Babylons downfall from the effusion of the 7. Vials. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.</note> The effusion whereof is by the best Expositors concluded to be so many <hi>degrees</hi> of the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>Beast:</hi> For as he arose by severall steps and gradations, so he must decrease by proportionable measures and abatements. This all or most agree on, though they differ exceedingly in the severall expositions of the Vials themselves, and it were as needlesse as it is an endlesse labour to present them all before you. I shall content my self to set in your view a few of those opinions which are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by the harmonie whereof you may make some guesse what probability this conjecture of the approch of Antichrists downfall carrieth with it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Viall</hi> which was powred out upon the <hi>earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viall. 1. <hi>Vers.</hi> 1.2.</note> vers. 2. seems to expound it self to be a plague powred upon <hi>the men that had the mark of the beast, and worshipped his Image,</hi> that is to say, upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary people or the common sort of Papists which (like the earth) are the <hi>lowest</hi> and <hi>basest part</hi> in the kingdome of Antichrist, the <hi>foot stoole</hi> upon which he treads.</p>
               <p>That which some conjecture, that by <hi>earth</hi> should be meant the common sort of <hi>godly Christians</hi> plagued and persecuted by Antichrist, bears no probability at all, or the least that may be; for by that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>Antichrist</hi> himselfe must be the <hi>Angel</hi> that <hi>pours</hi> out this <hi>viall,</hi> and godly Christians those which receive the <hi>marke of the Beast,</hi> for upon the effusion of this viall, the plague broke out upon them that had received that mark.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second Viall</hi> was <hi>poured out upon the Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viall 2.</note> on the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>great ones</hi> thereof, say some, but not with much likelihood of truth; for that I conceive
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136952:35"/>to be not only a warrantable but an undeniable rule which some judicious expositors lay down; <hi>viz.</hi> that the generall <hi>subject</hi> of all the Vials is the <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church</hi> or <hi>world,</hi> and the particular subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon each severall viall is poured out is some <hi>part</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> in that Antichristian state. And therefore they speak with much more probability, who by <hi>Sea</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Doctrine, Religion, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> of that Antichristian Church, which was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together into <hi>one body,</hi> as it were into <hi>one Sea,</hi> and <hi>combination of waters</hi> in the <hi>Counsell of</hi> Trent, and was then separated from the Orthodox Christian Doctrine of the Scripture (as <hi>the waters from the drie land in the third dayes creation</hi>) and might well be called a <hi>Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9.10.</note> the Doctrine of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Sea</hi> of that Romane doctrine. Upon which when <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>others</hi> after him had <hi>poured</hi> out their <hi>Vials,</hi> this <hi>Sea</hi> turned into <hi>bloud,</hi> i. e. it was <hi>discovered</hi> and <hi>convinced</hi> to be a <hi>bloudy</hi> Religion, a <hi>dead</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> a deep Sea of <hi>thick, black, stinking</hi> bloud: it being a doctrine that doth not hold forth the <hi>clensing, quickning, pacifying, purifying</hi> bloud of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> as the Sea in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did; but it holds forth <hi>the bloud of a dead man,</hi> a <hi>dead Christ,</hi> and <hi>dead Ordinances,</hi> dead to any spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, fitter to <hi>pollute</hi> then to <hi>purge</hi> the Conscience;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</note> yea a doctrine that teacheth <hi>bloud,</hi> the <hi>murdering</hi> of Kings, the <hi>massacring</hi> of the people and members of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>There be that by <hi>Sea</hi> chuse rather to understand whole Nations, People, Kingdomes, Provinces, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesses, as in <hi>Luthers</hi> time; The Reader may please himselfe, and if he would have more variety looke
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:136952:36"/>into those Authors that have written on this subject, and he may have enough; but that is not my work.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Viall</hi> (therefore) is poured out <hi>on the rivers and fountains of waters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viall. 3. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4.</note> which are the <hi>Romane Tyrants and persecutors</hi> as some conceive: for <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came bloud</hi> too; <hi>bloudy</hi> Tyrants, <hi>bloudy</hi> persecutours, like their doctrine. And this opinion is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, but extended in a larger sense by others, to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops, Priests Jesuites,</hi> and all other <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons,</hi> Agents and Factors for Antichrist; who, as the <hi>Rivers</hi> doe the Sea, carry forth this bloudy Religion and doctrine, and worship through the earth <hi>to and fro</hi> among the Nations, and then like the Rivers <hi>run back again</hi> into the Sea from whence they came, and fill it againe with the riches and revenues of the Nations, till they have drain'd the whole world into that immense Ocean.</p>
               <p>This Viall some would have poured out in <hi>Queene Eliz.</hi> Reigne, when in the year 1581. she by consent of the Parliament made the Statute for the banishing of Priests and Jesuites from the Kingdome, under pain of high Treason: But whether this exposition will not be too narrow, both in regard of <hi>time, place,</hi> and <hi>plague,</hi> I leave to the judgement of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Viall poured out on the Sun,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viall 4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.8.</note> was not as it seems to hurt the <hi>Sun,</hi> and so the <hi>Sun</hi> must not be any any <hi>part</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> in the Antichristian state, but to <hi>arme</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> (whatsoere it be) with a <hi>scalding scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence</hi> to wound and burne and torment men withall.</p>
               <p>Some of those that make the <hi>Sun</hi> to be some <hi>part</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> in the Antichristian world, would have it to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:136952:36"/>be that transcendent light which the Pope assumes to himselfe (as the Sun is the greatest Luminarie in the Heavens) whereby he <hi>gives authority</hi> to Scriptures, to doctrines, to worship, to government, to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, &amp;c. And the <hi>Angell</hi> that poured out this Viall upon him, the Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> (also) and her Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (among other States and Kingdomes) taking away the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> making <hi>it,</hi> and the <hi>defence</hi> of it <hi>high Treason.</hi> Some the <hi>House of Austria,</hi> the <hi>chiefe Governour</hi> in the Antichristian state of most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent lustre and brightnesse; and the <hi>Angell</hi> that poured out this Viall of Gods wrath to be the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> going forth like another <hi>Angell</hi> of God, and slaying many thousands of the Host of that blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Sennacherib.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But other that make the <hi>Sun</hi> to be but the <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>instrument,</hi> which the <hi>Angel</hi> of God useth to make it more <hi>vexatious</hi> and <hi>tormenting</hi> to men of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian state, by the <hi>Sun</hi> understand Christ himself, but without any shadow of probability, since so some created Angell should have used the Ministery of Christ in the effusion of this Viall; whereas it is most probable, that it is Christ the <hi>Angell</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> that poures out all the Vials by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of other <hi>created Angels,</hi> or <hi>Creatures</hi> whatsoever. Others ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with much more dexterity by <hi>Sun</hi> understand the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> (the <hi>purest</hi> and <hi>perfectest body</hi> of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> under the Heavens) the preaching whereof by a more abundant effusion of the Holy Ghost (in the dayes of the pouring out of this Viall) being raised to infinite more purity and power than in those misty cloudy times of blindnesse and ignorance, wherein Antichrist reigned without controll, doth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:136952:37"/>make the Scriptures to be of such a <hi>vexing, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> influence, as it maketh men (members or friends of Antichrist) that doe oppose it, to <hi>blaspheme the Name of God.</hi> And so the <hi>Angel</hi> that poures out this Viall may be those who (though not by their <hi>nature,</hi> yet) by their <hi>office</hi> are <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Messengers,</hi> even the faithfull Ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; And as the Scriptures shall be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more cleerely</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> preacht, so this <hi>Viall</hi> shall <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more aboundantly</hi> and <hi>tormentingly</hi> be poured out, till that time come, when <hi>the light of the Moone shall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be seven-fold as the light of seven dayes, Isai.</hi> 30.26. at which time (saith M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>Brightman</hi>) this <hi>Viall</hi> shall have its compleat and perfect effusion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fifth Viall</hi> is poured out upon the <hi>seat of the Beast,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fifth Viall. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.10.</note> by which some of good repute and learning understand the <hi>Forme</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>government,</hi> which is <hi>Monarchicall</hi> or <hi>Sole Episcopall Authoritie</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiasticall causes;</hi> which is another <hi>throne distinct</hi> from that universall Supremacie of the Pope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he challengeth transcendent authoritie over all Kings and Princes, (and whereupon he hath exalted himself above all that is called God, whether Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, or Ministers of the Gospel,) and the <hi>Angel</hi> that poures out this Viall to be such <hi>Protestant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> that doe discover the <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> of this kinde of church government, but especially the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hath not only discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to be Antichristian, but as Antichristian hath thrust it out by head and shoulders; not in a <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous popular</hi> way, but with so much <hi>wisdome, courage, judgement</hi> and <hi>Pietie,</hi> as that one may see and say it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:136952:37"/>not a <hi>Viall</hi> poured out by a <hi>weake</hi> and an <hi>unadvised multitude,</hi> but by an <hi>Angel</hi> of God, by the heavenly Ministers of his wrath. Some by the <hi>seat of the Beast</hi> understand the whole <hi>kingdome</hi> of Antichrist; but others (and with more probabilitie) the <hi>Citie of Rome;</hi> (not when it was besieged and sack'd by <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. <hi>Anno</hi> 1527. as <hi>Artopoeus</hi> casts it; but) when it shall be <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally layd waste;</hi> according to the prophesie of the Sybyll,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>sixth Viall</hi> poured out upon <hi>Euphrates</hi> is <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> understood by some;
<note place="margin">Sixth Viall. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.12.</note> of a <hi>River</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> by others, which hinders the passage of those Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Countries into Judea; the literall <hi>drying up</hi> whereof as of the Red sea and Jordane shall <hi>prepare a way</hi> for the <hi>Jewes</hi> to returne to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to entertain the Gospel and Kingdome of Jesus Christ; these be <hi>the Kings</hi> here mentioned in this verse: as all the <hi>Redeemed</hi> are called, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.

               <p>Vnder the <hi>seventh</hi> and last <hi>Viall</hi> poured out <hi>on the aire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seventh Viall. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.17.</note> some contend for <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>plagues</hi> to be poured out upon the <hi>whole Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> who is called the <hi>prince that ruleth in the aire;</hi> some, as <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:136952:38"/>others, as <hi>Concomitants</hi> of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; because <hi>the voice</hi> out of the <hi>Temple, from the Throne,</hi> cries, <hi>It is done,</hi> in the same vers. Yet there are who keeping more close in their Exposition of these seven Vials to the state of the Antichristian Church, and so making all the subjects upon which all the Vials are poured out, some <hi>part</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> in that state, doe understand by <hi>aire,</hi> the <hi>aire</hi> of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church;</hi> and conceive it to be (the same with the <hi>smoke that arose out of the bottomlesse pit,</hi> Chap. 9.1.2.) namely, nothing else but the <hi>darknesse</hi> of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> that fils the Kingdome and Region of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
               <p>But I am travell'd further then I need, in giving you an account of the severall opinions of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the two last Vials; for most of our judicious Divines conceive this age to be under the effusion of the fourth Viall, and then if by the <hi>Seat of the beast</hi> (upon which the fifth Viall is poured out) be meant <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe (as it is greatly probable) then surely the ruine and downfall of that <hi>beast</hi> which <hi>sits</hi> upon that <hi>seat</hi> cannot be a calculation of any long expectation. And that is the main result which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire may be observed, that all this variety of opinions (and much more which might be produced, were it not rather to distract than to instruct you) concerning the Vials, and the subjects on which they are poured out, is yet picht by their Authors upon such times and periods, that entertaine which you please, they will allow you no long time for the expectation of the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>downfall</hi> of that <hi>man</hi> of <hi>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any man shall demand of me,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> saying, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this approch of Babylons fall which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

               </p>
               <p>I answer, First,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                  </label> that without all Controversie the good of all the Protestant Churches in Christendom is deeply concern'd in the downefall of Antichrist, else what meanes that Exultation in heaven mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 19.1.2.</p>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.1.2.</note> I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Hallelu-jah: Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For true and righteous are his judgements, for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornications, and hath avenged the bloud of his servants at her hand. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not the voice of the Saints and people of God <hi>triumphing</hi> in the <hi>confusion of Antichrist?</hi> and in what <hi>heaven?</hi> not in the heaven of <hi>glory,</hi> but in the heaven of <hi>grace;</hi> for as by <hi>Earth</hi> the generall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the Vials, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. is meant the <hi>earthly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt state</hi> of the Antichristian <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>world,</hi> so (in opposition to that) by <hi>heaven</hi> is meant the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly state</hi> and <hi>Complexion</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> And if so, <hi>England</hi> will have as much cause to beare a part in that song as any other Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; yea she may justly sing the <hi>Altus</hi> in that <hi>Hallelu-jah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But secondly, that <hi>Englands good</hi> is yet more neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly concern'd in the <hi>downfall</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> I shall only observe from the premised inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the <hi>Vials,</hi> that as we see many in the naturall death die <hi>upward</hi> and by degrees in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame limbs and members before death seize upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:136952:39"/>the <hi>heart,</hi> that being <hi>primum vivens &amp; ultimum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> that <hi>lives,</hi> and the <hi>last</hi> that <hi>dies;</hi> so must <hi>Antichrist,</hi> he must dye <hi>abroad</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and in other Kingdomes, before he die at <hi>Rome</hi> in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire; he must dye in his <hi>Catholiques,</hi> in his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> &amp;c. before he dye in his <hi>Person,</hi> that being also the <hi>first</hi> that <hi>lived,</hi> and the <hi>last</hi> that shall <hi>dye</hi> in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian state.</p>
               <p>And therefore if there be found many Symptoms of death upon his limbs in the effusion of divers of the Vials upon his Catholiques, Doctrine, Doctors, Worship, Ceremonies (and the like) here in <hi>England,</hi> as it were together (for it is not conceived necessary that the effusion of one Viall should be determined, before the other begin;) If the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> had never such a scalding influence <hi>poured</hi> out upon them to <hi>torment</hi> the <hi>men</hi> of the <hi>Antichristian Church,</hi> as in this morning of <hi>Englands revivings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

If the <hi>sole</hi> Episcopall <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (which if it be not the <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> I am sure is one of the <hi>stayes</hi> of that seat) never received such a blow and wound in <hi>England</hi> as by this <hi>Happy Parliament,</hi> which like another <hi>Angel</hi> of God hath poured out this <hi>Viall</hi> or at lest <hi>some drops</hi> of this <hi>Viall</hi> upon it? If these, I say, and the like Symptoms of death be found upon the limbs of that <hi>man of sin,</hi> we shall humbly hope that he is no <hi>long-lived</hi> man amongst us, but that as he hath we hope given up the Ghost in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many other Reformed Churches, so also he lies <hi>drawing on</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> his

<note place="margin">Second Arg. The stay of the flight of Gods people. <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The second argument of hope, is that <hi>God hath staied the flight of his people,</hi> were they not all upon <hi>David</hi>'s wish, <hi>Oh that I had wings like a Dove,</hi> and as many as could disengage themselves from their intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements here, were they not even upon the tiptoe, ready to take their flight, where they might happily find an hole where they might hide themselves from the storme and tempest, that was comming upon us, with a dreadfull aspect and noise. But God did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and even miraculously stay their flight; I could tell you of a ship fraught with Christians that after they had lancht forth a day or two into the deep, were struck all sick as it were by an immediate hand from heaven, and glad to turn their sayles and come back againe for cure and recovery. I could tell you of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vessel from the Irish coasts, which the winds had brought within view of the American shore, and were even now <hi>hawling</hi> to Land, when the great master of the winds in a moment of time commanded them to blow with a contrary blast, and in one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued storme to drive the vessel back again, so that in an incredible short space the passengers found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the very same coasts from which they first hoysed up their sayles. Preparations were made by some very considerable Personages for a Western voyage, the vessell provided, and goods ready to be carried <hi>aboard,</hi> when an unexpected and almost a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous providence diverted that designe in the very nick of time.</p>
               <p>I read in the Roman history, when the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:136952:41"/>had once turned back before the Sabines their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in the day of battle, and at the prayer of <hi>Romulus, Jupiter</hi> stayed their flight, who on a sudden returned upon their pursuing enemies, and overcame them; <hi>Romulus</hi> in way of thankfull acknowledgement and remembrance of such a miracle, built a Temple in the place where the flight was stayed, and to <hi>Jupiter's</hi> names added another <hi>title,</hi> calling him from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <hi>Jupiter Stator:</hi> The immediate hand of divine providence hath made many even miraculous stayes of his flying servants for which they have cause in a like manner to erect monuments of thankfulnesse and may honour God with a new title <hi>Jehovah Stator,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah <hi>that stayed the flight of his poor persecuted flying people,</hi> for surely it speaks in more then ordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that God in tends good for his people; for as when God intends to destroy a people or place, he gives his servants some secret warning and bids them fly for their lives, as to <hi>Lot</hi> when <hi>Sodome</hi> must be burnt with fire and brimstone, <hi>Escape for thy life,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.17.</note> look not behind thee, escape to the mountain.</hi> And the Christians in Jerusalem before it was destroyed, heard a voice by night crying, <hi>Ite ad Pellam,
<note place="margin">Joseph <hi>de bello Jud.</hi>
                     </note> Ite ad Pellam;</hi> away to <hi>Pella,</hi> fly to <hi>Pella.</hi> So on the other side when God doth in such a wonderfull manner stay their flight, yea doth bring them back again by a strong hand out of Captivity, surely the meaning of it is, that word of God to Israel looking which way they might fly from the Egyptian Army, <hi>Stand still,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13.</note> and see the salvation of the Lord,</hi> or like that word in <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Grape-gatherer concerning the cluster that was ready to be destroyed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isai.</hi> 65.8.</note>
                  <hi>Destroy it not for there is a blessing in it.</hi> Stay, stay, for I have yet a blessing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:136952:42"/>for <hi>England.</hi> Hath God think you staid so many of his Worthies, and brought back others, to slay them by the hands of Papists and murderers? I blesse God I want faith to beleeve it. Surely this Stay of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands and Return of many of the precious sonnes of Sion, I cannot look upon, but as the first fruits of our Resurrection.</p>
               <p>A third ground of hope is,
<note place="margin">3. Arg. The Colledge of skilfull Physicians.</note>
                  <hi>That God hath called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Colledge of skilfull Physicians</hi> to discover our disease and study our cure. This shews that God is not yet willing that <hi>England</hi> should dye; as when a King commands all his skilfull Physicians to goe to a sick favourite and lay their heads together to find out the cause and cure of his sicknesse, it is an argument he is unwilling that favourite should miscarry for want of means of recovery.</p>
               <p>When Israel was a dying people, the complaint was,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.22.</note>
                  <hi>Is there no balme in Gilead, is there no Physician there?</hi> When God will not have a wound healed, he hides away the balme that should doe it, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to deny recovery, ordinarily he denies a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician; at least he doth not usually create extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means when he intends to deny deliverance and reviving. Other Parliaments have given up the ghost as soon as they have been brought forth into the light <hi>The children have come to the birth, and there hath not been strength to bring forth:</hi> But if you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what an eminent and mighty arme God put forth in <hi>calling</hi> this Parliament together, and in <hi>keeping</hi> of them together; how he sent forth his own <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it were through the Kingdome to gather Votes for their election, and since their comming together hath commanded their Votes for the Kingdome against a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:136952:42"/>torrent of potent opposition: can ye think God hath done all this to let <hi>England</hi> perish? Other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been Parliaments of dayes, or hours ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this of months, and is like to be a Parliament of years; no weapon form'd against it hath prospered; there have been no inchantments against this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor divination against this great Counsell of the Kingdome. His Majesty hath been pleased to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie this Parliament with the broad Seale of the Medes and Persians, that it cannot be altered; and is all this that <hi>England</hi> may dye under the hands of her Physicians? and give up the ghost in their armes? God forbid we should think such a thought; Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this time it shall be said of this Parliament, <hi>What hath God wrought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit that God hath poured out so abundantly on the Kingdome</hi> may be a fourth securing pledge that God hath some thoughts to doe <hi>England</hi> good;
<note place="margin">4. Aug. The effusion of the Spirit.</note> I am sure it is promised in <hi>Joel</hi> as an <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of <hi>deliverance</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> vers. 28.

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>what hath been done, hath been done upon the spirits of men. Not by might nor power but by my spirit saith the Lord.</hi> not by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>Armes,</hi> not by <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>compulsion</hi> but by a secret <hi>influence</hi> upon <hi>mens spirits</hi> hath the worke been carried on all this while, <hi>warming</hi> them when deadly <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>frozen entouraging</hi> them whem <hi>despairingly poor</hi> and <hi>time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and <hi>heightning</hi> them with dangerously <hi>low</hi> and <hi>sinking:</hi> have I not seen men like <hi>Deers</hi> to day, and like <hi>Lyons</hi> to morrow, like <hi>fainting men</hi> now, and like the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> anon, clothed with a kinde of <hi>omnipotence</hi> so that no opposition or hazard hath been able to turn them out of their road, or to stand
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:136952:65"/>before them, and this in such a secret concurrence and combination of providence, not by communication and discourse, but when men have been seperated and at distance, that it seemes not lesse miraculous than that which is reported of the <hi>septuagint,</hi> who shut up in their severall studies, and not suffered to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their thoughts and labours one to another, did yet by a secret instinct, meet in such an harmonious translation of the Bible that they differ'd neither in sence nor words. To see Lords and Commons so strangely raised and changed (as it were) in the frame of their spirits, as if they were not the same men. Parliament and City, the several! Counties even from the remotest parts of the Kingdome concentred in the same designe and humbly desires of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; notwithstanding all art and industry of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant agents to put all into a combustion. Is not this <hi>his work</hi> who gathers <hi>the waters of the Sea into an heap</hi> and makes them run which way he please? yea if you will call to mind the deportment and behaviour of that ragged regiment that should have fought the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops battels</hi> against <hi>Scotland,</hi> between whom and the barbarous ignorantmoores, there went (one would think) but a payre of sheeres, from whom the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious partie in their travell might have expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but inhumane violence and spoile (which oh how greatfull a service would it have been to their masters?) I say if you will remember in what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected posture they carried themselves, much more like <hi>Bishops</hi> then those that set them a worke, pulling up of <hi>railes</hi> which <hi>they had erected;</hi> calling upon idle ministers to preach, whose silence the Bishops did not onely beare with but approve of; threatning scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:136952:65"/>Priests whom they supported, letting out the streame of that severity they used against Papists onely, and their popish commanders, whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops spared and favoured, (all the world, but their own Chaplains and favourits will bear me witnesse I do them no wrong) in a word (for particulars are so many) to see a poor rude untaught company <hi>keeping</hi> such a <hi>visitation</hi> in their progresse as the Bishops hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever did since Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, must not all the beholders confesse (unlesse more blind then the <hi>Egyptian</hi> sorcerers,) <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> the <hi>finger</hi> yea the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon their spirits, forcing them like <hi>Jordan</hi> in a <hi>contrary streame</hi> to their wonted course; which of the <hi>Puritans</hi> (as they once used to call them) had catechised this poor ignorant multitude before they went? or which of their Commanders did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse into them these principles? surely their Masters were men of another Notion. But this was the worke of <hi>him</hi> who <hi>created</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of man, and hath the <hi>residue of spirits in his owne hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The God of spirits onely can worke on, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, and turne, and change, and mould, and fashion, the spirit of man as he pleaseth. Consider the <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> the <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> the <hi>unwearied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>undauntednesse</hi> of those that are embarqued in the great affairs of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>state</hi> both at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That which hath been done hath been wrought of the very Rock of difficulty and opposition.</hi>

                  <hi>I feared the wrath of the enemy least their adversaries should behave themselves strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Wrath, strange wrath, unheard of cruelty; if I leave my people in their adversaries hands, they will shew them no mercy, I will not doe it saith God, <hi>this shall not be;</hi> there he had respect to his <hi>mercy:</hi> mercy could not behold such strange wrath and crueltie,

Strange pride against God,</hi> as well as <hi>strange wrath against his people;</hi> there he wrought for his power and wisedome, that the Enemie should not rob him of his praise and glory; and as you hear God <hi>saying,</hi> so you may hear him <hi>swearing,</hi> yea saying and <hi>swearing</hi> over and over againe (or at least repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what he had said and sworn before) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. <hi>I said I will poure out my fury,</hi> vers. 8. and <hi>I said</hi> so againe, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and a third time, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and <hi>swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> too (as I say) <hi>I lifted up my hand,</hi> vers. 15. and <hi>I lifted up my hand to them in the wildernesse that I would scatter them,</hi> vers. 23. there you have the <hi>form</hi> of an <hi>oath,</hi> though not the <hi>words</hi> of an <hi>oath,</hi> as you may see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. <hi>I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>I have lifted up my hand, that I will not take from a thread,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>I have sworne.</hi> But what then hindered the execution of Gods <hi>word</hi> and <hi>oath?</hi> It is as often expressed in the same place, <hi>I wrought for my Names sake,</hi> vers. 8. <hi>I wrought for my Names sake,</hi> vers. 14. and so a third time, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. and a fourth time, <hi>vers.</hi> 44. Surely God hath not ordinarily nor easily denied the solicitations of this argument, even then when his word and oath have seemed to have concluded a peoples destruction.

The wayes of God are in the Clouds, and his paths in the deep waters; who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his counsellor, &amp;c?</hi> As therefore those reverend Divines who did for many yeares together (till of very late dayes) with <hi>one lip</hi> foretell of an <hi>hour of temptation, wrath</hi> and fearfull <hi>desolation</hi> hastning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>England,</hi> did not do it by vertue of a <hi>spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,</hi> or <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> (with Jonas) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laying a <hi>fatall</hi> and <hi>peremptory necessity</hi> upon their predictions (which had been to great a presumption, and an high <hi>breach of divine prerogative</hi>) but meerly out of a <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>serious observation,</hi> of the <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>almost desperate height,</hi> to which all manner <hi>of sin</hi> was sweld in the Kingdome; and other <hi>direfull symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> of <hi>divine displeasure</hi> upon us, the diversion whereof hitherto is not therefore to be accounted an argument of any <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>errour</hi> and precipitancy in them, but meerely as a <hi>demonstration</hi> and <hi>monument</hi> of Gods free-grace, and <hi>prerogative royall,</hi> reserving to himself liberty to spare <hi>when</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> he pleaseth, though lying under most eminent guilt and danger; So have I presumed to hold out these <hi>arguments</hi> of reviving <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> to you and the whole Kingdome; not as revelations of unchangeable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:136952:76"/>but as <hi>probable fore-runners</hi> of approaching sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the dawning of the most glorious and happy <hi>times</hi> that ever <hi>England</hi> saw, upon which if God should yet command the black clouds of dismaying feares and dangers to returne againe, who can doubt that (though these considerations breath warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and sweet consolation) yet God should be able to give a justifying accompt of his dealings to all the world, and <hi>England</hi> finde cause enough to lay her hand to her mouth, <hi>to be ashamed and confounded before the Lord.</hi>

               <p>These and the like, a thousand whereof I could set before you, are arguments of such authority, that they do as it were binde Gods hands, and <hi>command</hi> him who is Almighty: They are not onely of an <hi>insinuating,</hi> but <hi>Commanding</hi> power, and surely therefore they that could take these arguments, and with them wrestle with God in the behalfe of the Kingdome, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the Angell, might doe God and the Kingdome Knights service, and instead of a <hi>Jacob</hi> be Knighted <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom it was said;

               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was a man of such a spirit; in mercies begd, he minds God more than himselfe; and therefore doth not only eye <hi>Gods praises in</hi> or <hi>with</hi> his <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: O prepare mercy and truth which may preserve me, so will I sing praise unto thy Name,</hi>
